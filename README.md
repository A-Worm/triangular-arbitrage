# triangular-arbitrage
Sample code for Triangular Arbitrage strategy bot using Binance wss.

Copy files to new directory and type:

```
npm install
npm run
```

Code will show info about order of the trades and next after connecting Binance it will show how much you can earn (or loose) traiding this strategy.
I want to add trade execution and code that will decide how much of each token we should trade, to get some profit.  

You can edit code and change the pairs you want to trade, to find which pairs set is most profitable.
